kinect_recording
==============

Code to record kinect rgb and d data, compress it, and play back on a topic


Where to place files:

None of this really matters if you change the appropriate code in the files to adjust for your own naming, this is just the way I have it. You could place the files in any catkin_ws with any package name but these are the packages I ended up having.

-Create a custom package directory (catkin_ws)
-Create packages for image_pipeline and learning_image_transport
-extract_images and depthExtraction go in image_view
-video_publisher goes in learning_image_transport
-Rakefile and .sh files can all go in any directory as long as they're together

USAGE:
-rake makeRGBDVideo --> After a brief delay, records the live video by extracting images then stiches a video losslessly compressed with codec ffv1 into an avi file
-rake publishVideo --> Extracts the images from the avi files and plays those images as a video on the topics /camera/rgb/image_color and /camera/depth_registered/image_raw

(the following are all used in the above two files)
-extract_images -> rosrun image_view extract_images _sec_per_frame:=0.01 image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
-depth_extraction -> rosrun image_vview depthExtraction _sec_per_frame:=0.01 image:=/camera/depth_registered/image_raw
-videoPublisher -> rosrun learning_image_transport videoPublisher (current directory) (name of folder that color images were exported to) (root name of files that the images were stored as) (color for color images, d for depth images) 
  ex. rosrun learning_image_transport videoPublisher $PWD images image color
